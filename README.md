# Radar

## Description 
Radar is a Palindrome. A Palindrome is a word, phrase or sequence that reads the same backwards as forward. Write a program that checks if the phrase entered in a palindrome.

## User Story
As a user, I would like an application that checks if a word is the same when the letters are reversed.
